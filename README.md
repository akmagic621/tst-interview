## Run program

Add any test cases to the `TestScenario` object. Also update the `getAllTests` method to include all of the tests you want to run in that `Seq`.

You can simply clone this repository, and run `scala <path-to-file>/BestGroupPriceSolution.scala` to see if all of the test cases you want to run worked.
